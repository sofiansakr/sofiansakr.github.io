### Hi there, Sofian Sakr
#### Data Analysis and Mathematical Simulation
![Data Analysis and Mathematical Simulation](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I am studying physics, both theoretical and experimental, and throughout my studies, I was introduced to computational physics which sparked my interest from the first project I did and how I can apply theories to practical projects. Afterward, I started taking more coursework related to that field. Now, I am fully focused on the connection between physics, data analysis and mathematical simulation.

Skills: Python |  OpenFOAM |  LaTeX |  Computational Physics |  Mathematical Modeling |  Monte Carlo Simulation
