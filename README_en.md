## Work Experience

### [HiWi for OpenFOAM Simulation â€” enaDyne, Germany *(01/2025 â€“ Present)*](https://github.com/sofiansakr/enaDyne/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)  
At enaDyne GmbH, I focus on the development and optimization of plasma-catalytic reactor designs for syngas production, primarily through simulation of SDBD systems using OpenFOAM. I generate meshes with GMSH and SkyMesh, integrate data from nonPDPSIM (e.g., electric fields and EHD forces), and run simulations on cloud servers using MPI parallelization. I also customize and extend solver source codes in C++ to enhance model accuracy and develop custom modules for project-specific needs.

#### ðŸ”§ Key Responsibilities:

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with OpenFOAM:**  
  - Developing and conducting detailed CFD simulations of plasma-catalytic reactorsâ€”especially Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD) systemsâ€”using OpenFOAM. I adapt solver C++ source code to include specific physical models and improve simulation accuracy and efficiency.

- **Mesh Generation and Preprocessing:**  
  - Creating meshes with GMSH for OpenFOAM simulations.  
  - Generating custom meshes with SkyMesh for nonPDPSIM to ensure compatibility and accuracy in multiphysics simulations.

- **Coupling Plasma and Flow:**  
  - Integrating electric fields and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) forces from nonPDPSIM into OpenFOAM to model plasma dynamicsâ€™ effect on gas flow and reaction zones.  
  - Simulating different gas mixtures in reactive flow environments under plasma influence to analyze syngas production performance.

- **High-Performance & Cloud Computing:**  
  - Running simulations on remote cloud infrastructure using MPI decomposition to reduce compute time and enable high-resolution studies.

- **Code Development & Optimization:**  
  - Extending solver capabilities and maintaining custom C++ modules in OpenFOAM tailored to project needs, improving numerical stability and speed.

## Courses & Projects

### Bachelor Thesis â€” ITP, UniversitÃ¤t Leipzig *(expected 09/2025)*  
<p align="center"><strong>"Complex Partition Function Zeros of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model"</strong></p>

- My thesis focuses on a computational investigation of the 2D Ising model, particularly analyzing complex zeros of the partition function. I applied high-precision numerical methods to determine Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros for large lattice sizes (up to L=128) using Python and Mathematica.  
- Techniques include high-order cumulants, root-finding algorithms, and exact enumeration of microstates. A key contribution was applying logarithmic finite-size corrections to estimate critical exponents accurately and understand phase transition effects.  
- Throughout, I deepened expertise in statistical physics, symbolic computation, and numerical analysis of critical phenomena.
